## Marks: 84 / 100

## Feedback
Meets and exceeds the requirements, with only a few minor issues.

Primarily, the app is unable to track the user while the screen is turned off, or at the very least is unable
to store the location data. There also appears to be a bug in your sensor service that prevents it from
working for more than a few iterations.

documentation. Your self-assessment form rarely details why you have made certain decisions in your project.
